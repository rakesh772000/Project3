          Taj Mahal , Mausoleum complex on the southern bank of the Yamuna
          River, outside Agra, India. It was built by the Mughal emperor Shah
          Jahān in memory of his wife, Mumtāz Maḥal, who died in 1631. The Taj
          complex, begun c. 1632, took 22 years to complete. At its centre lies
          a square garden area bounded by two smaller, oblong sections, one
          comprising the mausoleum and the other an entrance gateway. The
          mausoleum, of pure-white marble inlaid with semiprecious stones, is
          flanked by two red sandstone buildings, a mosque on one side and an
          identical building for aesthetic balance on the other. It stands on a
          high marble plinth with a minaret at each corner. It has four
          identical facades, each with a massive central arch 108 ft (33 m)
          high, and is surmounted by a bulbous double dome and four domed
          kiosks. Its interior, with fine, restrained stone decoration, centres
          on an octagonal chamber containing the marble tombs, enclosed by a
          perforated marble screen, with sarcophagi below. Regarded as one of
          the world’s most beautiful buildings, it was designated a UNESCO World
          Heritage site in 1983. Steps have been taken since the late 1990s to
          reduce air pollution that has damaged the facade of the building.

          Shah Jahan’s vision brought a delicate beauty and detail to Mughal
          architecture. The Taj Mahal is without a doubt Shah Jahan’s most
          famous achievement. The Taj Mahal, located in Agra, is a white marble
          mausoleum constructed between 1632 and 1648 in memory of his third
          wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The palace, which reflects the Islamic garden of
          paradise and was built by 20,000 men, is generally considered as the
          greatest accomplishment in Mughal architecture. The pristine
          architectural masterpiece represents the best of Mughal artistic
          heritage in India and is widely recognized as a symbol of life,
          attracting about 7-8 million visitors per year.

          Mughal architecture is a distinct Indo-Islamic architectural style
          that evolved in Northern and central India from the 16th to the 18th
          century under the patronage of Mughal emperors. It’s a stunning
          symmetrical and decorative style of Persian, Turkish, and Indian
          architecture. Some of the most unforgettable Mughal architecture was
          created during Akbar the Great’s reign (1556-1605) and under the
          vision of Shah Jahan (1628-1658). Many palaces, mosques, gardens, and
          mausoleums were built by Akbar the Great. His architecture is notable
          for the use of sandstone on a grand scale, as well as vast enclosed
          courtyards and doomed shallow prayer halls. One of Akbar’s most
          stellar achievements was the construction of his father Humayun’s tomb
          in Delhi. Humayun’s Tomb, commissioned by Humayun’s wife in 1562 and
          designed by a Persian architect, was the first garden tomb on the
          Indian subcontinent and the first building to use red sandstone on
          such a large scale. It is the first building in India to use the
          Persian double dome with an outer layer supporting the white marble
          exterior, a previously unseen material. This decorated facade style
          was a significant contribution to Mughal architecture in the future.

          In the first century CE, buildings were constructed to house a holy
          symbol of a certain deity, which could then be adorned with sculptural
          figures of them to remember their mythological adventures and provide
          a place for worshippers to leave offerings and perform rituals. As a
          god’s home, the temple was considered a holy place where heaven and
          earth met, supplying them with a magnificent palace. Temple
          architecture has a long history in India. It has developed in all
          regions of the country. Despite the fact that the style’s roots are
          the same, there is a significant distinction and variation in
          architectural styles in temple architecture. This variation is
          primarily due to India’s geographical, climatic, racial, ethnic and
          historical diversity. There are three broad styles of Indian temple
          architecture: Nagara (northern style), Vesara (mixed style), and
          Dravida (southern style). Each of these types has its own distinct
          cultural influences and lineages. Hindu temple architecture represents
          a fusion of arts, dharmic ideas, convictions, traditions, and the
          Hindu way of life.
